/**
 * An automatically-expanding array that can store any kind of (homogenous) data
 *
 * Note: NULL is considered to be a valid entry. This means users can insert a
 * NULL into the vector if they choose to.
 *
 * As entries are added to it, the array will automatically grow.
 * (sort of like a C++ vector or Java ArrayList)
 *
 * 'size' is the number of actual objects held in the vector,
 * which is not necessarily equal to its storage capacity.
 *
 * 'capacity' is the storage space currently allocated for the vector,
 * expressed in terms of elements. This is also the maximum number of elements
 the array can currently hold.
 * 'size' will always be less than or equal to 'capacity'.
 *
 * The reason size and capacity are two different variables is that
 * the extra space allows us to accommodate for growth without
 * the need to reallocate on each insertion.
 *
 * Understand the difference between size and capacity! The last element of
 * the vector is at index 'size - 1', but the array reserves memory for
 * 'capacity' elements.
 *
 * The vector is initialized with a capacity of 10 and size of 0.  The user can
 * add up to 10 entries and the array will not need to be reallocated-- just
 change
 * 'size'.  For example, if you have inserted two entries into the vector, the
 * capacity will still be 10, but the size will be 2.
 *
 * When the user wants to add the 11th entry, the array will be reallocated to
 * hold 20 entries. If that fills up, reallocate it to hold 40 entries, and so
 * on.

 * Why double the size each time rather than just adding another 10
 * elements? Reallocations can be expensive, and the performance
 * will probably suffer if you do a lot of them.
 *
 * When the vector is relatively empty, that is, when its size is 1/4th
 * of its capacity, it should be reduced to half capacity to free up space.

 *
 * Also, if the new size of vector is less than or equal to 1/4th the capacity,
 * then you should keep halving the capacity until it is just about twice the
