* Reallocate memory block

* the new location is returned. The content of the memory block is preserved
* up to the lesser of the new and old sizes, even if the block is moved. If
* the new size is larger, the value of the newly allocated portion is
* indeterminate.
*
* In case that ptr is NULL, the function behaves exactly as malloc, assigning
* a new block of size bytes and returning a pointer to the beginning of it.
*
* In case that the size is 0, the memory previously allocated in ptr is
* deallocated as if a call to free was made, and a NULL pointer is returned.
*
* @param ptr
*    Pointer to a memory block previously allocated with malloc(), calloc()
*    or realloc() to be reallocated.
*
*    If this is NULL, a new block is allocated and a pointer to it is
*    returned by the function.
*
* @param size
*    New size for the memory block, in bytes.
*
*    If it is 0 and ptr points to an existing block of memory, the memory
*    block pointed by ptr is deallocated and a NULL pointer is returned.
*
* @return
*    A pointer to the reallocated memory block, which may be either the
*    same as the ptr argument or a new location.
*
*    The type of this pointer is void*, which can be cast to the desired
*    type of data pointer in order to be dereferenceable.
*
*    If the function failed to allocate the requested block of memory,
*    a NULL pointer is returned, and the memory block pointed to by
*    argument ptr is left unchanged.
